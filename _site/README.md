# Personal Website

This is my personal website built with Jekyll and the Tactile theme.

## How to add new posts

1. Go to the `_posts` folder.
2. Create a new file with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
3. Add front matter like:

```
---
layout: post
title: "My Post Title"
categories: category-name
---
Content goes here.
```

4. Commit and push to GitHub. GitHub Pages will update automatically.
