### Hi â€” I'm Animesh Nautiyal

I'm an MTech student (Technology & Development) at **CTARA, IIT Bombay** with a background in computer science. I work on health informatics, geospatial visualizations, and data-driven projects.  

On this site I document:
- **Flute practice & progress**
- **Exercise logs and calisthenics**
- **Climate change reflections**
- **Language learning (e.g., Spanish, Hindi practice notes)**
- **Coding, tutorials, and D3.js experiments**
- Short articles and technical notes

I follow a plant-based (vegan) diet and love turning messy data into clear visuals.
